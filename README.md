Over the course of this analysis, I discovered different ways to look at data in a .csv, and how to use that to break down different analyses for the School Board (the Client). I used .loc and .iloc to great affect, and can already see hwo it might be used in day-to-day analysis to get a broad level overview, as well as a much zoomed-in version depending on the requirements of the project. i was able to find the count of students, determine average funding, and determine the scores for each student in a variety of categories, which would be useful in the long-term planning of curriculum, budgets, teacher vs. student denisty and more.
