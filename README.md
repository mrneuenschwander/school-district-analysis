# school-district-analysis
First dive into Pandas and Anaconda

## This is Deliverable 6, located at the bottom of the Student_Data_CHALLENGE_code.ipynb file. It is copied here for convenience.
Over the course of this analysis, I discovered different ways to look at data in a .csv, and how to use that to break the data down for different analyses by the School Board (the Client). I used .loc and .iloc to great effect, and can already see how the tools in this module might be used in day-to-day analysis to get an exacutive-level overview, as well as a finer zoomed-in version of a given section, depending on the requirements of the project. I was able to find the count of students per school, determine average funding by school type, and determine the scores for each student in a variety of categories, which would be useful in the long-term planning of curriculum, budgets, teacher vs. student denisty and more.
